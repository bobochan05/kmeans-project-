# Capstone Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on applying **end-to-end machine learning workflows** to a real-world dataset. The goal is to move beyond model building and emphasize the full data science pipeline — from data understanding and preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and interpretation.

The project is designed to demonstrate **practical ML thinking**, not just algorithm usage, making it suitable for academic evaluation, portfolios, and research-oriented programs.
